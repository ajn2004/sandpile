Pretty basic sandpile simulation / c++ experiment for personal
exploration.

The simulation is written in sand.cpp and is 'done' in a
sense. Uncommenting out key lines will allow this to be built into a

The simulation can be visualized with simulationGui/build.sh which will build the simulationGui.cpp code and the simulation, to give a visualization of the computation.

In main.cpp
