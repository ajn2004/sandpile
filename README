Pretty basic sandpile simulation / c++ experiment for personal
exploration.

The simulation is written in sand.cpp and is 'done' in a
sense. Uncommenting out key lines will allow this to be built into a
python file using build.sh in the main folder.

The simulation can be visualized with simulationGui/build.sh which will build the simulationGui.cpp code and the simulation, to give a visualization of the computation.

In sandpileGui/gui.cpp you can adjust the scaling factor to explore computational efficiency.

Make sure opencv is installed on your system
If you want to make this a python function use
```pip install pybind11```
first

Let me know if you have any issues and I'll be happy to get back to you.
Cheers,
Andrew
